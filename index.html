         target="_blank">Painting</a> is one of my many fun hobbies I enjoy doing. I started paitning at the age of 8 and have loved doing it ever since then. I like to paint and draw in my free time. I like painting various landscapes from nature using different colors to make it look better. Painting is very relaxing and is a fun hobby I have developed. </p>   
    <h2>Sports</h2>

    <p> Another one of my hobbies is playing sports. The sports i enjoy playing is volleyball, badminton and football. Volleyball is fun to play with my friends and as well in the school. I developed this as a hobby because I like trying out different things and playing new sports.  </p>
<h2>Reading</h2>

    <p>Lastly, I also really enjoy reading. Ideveloped a hobby for reading well over last summer and since then I love reading books. Over the summer, to beat the boredom I read atleast 10 books. Reading has helped me expand my vocabulary and is a great hobby I have.</p>
<h4>Thanks for Reading</h4>
